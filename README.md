The project was developed using Unity 2017.4.7f1 so it's recommended to use the same version or higher to run it.

## Acknowledgments
This project was developed following an Alura course avaliable [here](https://www.alura.com.br/carreira-desenvolvimento-jogos-unity). All 3D models and UI components used in the project were made available by Alura, while the scripts were developed by me during the course.
